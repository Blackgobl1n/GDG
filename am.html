        <h1><u>ABOUT MYSELF</u></h1>
        <p>My name is David, a 200 level Engineernig student of covenant university. I've been a frontend developer for the past 2 years now. I feel like the reason why i chose this path was because of my dad, and i can never thank him enough for the sacrifices he has done for me, he has taken me to different coding camps so i could work and perfect my skills. I've been working on HTML and CSS for quite a while now and i believe i can say that "I'M GOOD", now i've been working on c++ to create my first and very own application.
