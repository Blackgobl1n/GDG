                <h1>WHAT I'VE ACHIEVED SO FAR</h1>
                <p>Ever since i learnt how to code HTML and CSS, i've created so many projects trying to hone my skills from making plane boring landing pages to creating interactive forms to replicating already popular websites to look exactly like them. This last holiday, i got the opportunity to work in a company as an intern and got the chance to be taught by one og their best developers. He taught me a lot of things and introduced me to the website named frontend mentor which i go to fro time to time whenever i want to get a project to work on by myself.</p>
